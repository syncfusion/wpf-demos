Patent and Copyright Indemnification: Syncfusion shall defend any action, suit or proceeding brought against Customer in so far as it is based on a claim that the Licensed Product delivered hereunder infringes any United States patent or copyright issued or registered, as of the date of this Agreement.  Indemnification hereunder shall be contingent upon Customer providing prompt notice of such claim in writing, and upon Customer granting Syncfusion full authority, information and assistance (at Syncfusion’s expense) for the defense of such claim.  Syncfusion shall pay all damages and costs awarded therein against Customer, but shall not be responsible for any compromise made without its consent.  Syncfusion may, at its option and expense, replace or modify the Licensed Product so that infringement will not exist or refund to Customer prepaid License Fees on a pro-rata basis.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Syncfusion’s indemnification hereunder shall not extend to any infringement or claim thereof which is based upon: (i) the combination of the Licensed Product delivered hereunder with any software or device not supplied by Syncfusion; (ii) specifications provided to Syncfusion; or (iii) modifications to the Licensed Product not performed by Syncfusion.

Maintenance and Support services subscriptions are provided in accordance with the terms of Syncfusion’s then-current support and maintenance policies.  A current version of those policies is available from Syncfusion upon request.  In the event that Customer declines to purchase and initiate Maintenance and Support services subscriptions at the time of installation of the Licensed Program, or in the event that Customer allows Maintenance and Support service coverage to lapse for any period of time, Customer agrees that: (i) Maintenance and Support service fees will be due, upon the resumption of Maintenance and Support services, for any period during which Customer declined to purchase Maintenance and Support services; or (ii) Customer must pay an upgrade fee to update the License Program(s) to the then-latest version.  Failure to maintain a Maintenance and Support services subscription will limit Customer’s right to use the Licensed Programs to create modified binaries for Customer’s product(s) as set forth in Section 4.2(f).
